I earned my Associate of The Royal Conservatory Diploma at 24 and I am teaching music part-time. Currently in my second year of a philosophy major, my schedule changes with my school commitments. You can find me teaching at the Saskatoon South LC on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 5 pm to 9 pm and at the Saskatoon North LC on Saturdays from 10 am to 5 pm. I've been teaching piano for nine years, five of those at LC. In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching movies, learning German, and practicing piano. My preferred means of communication is through a home phone or email, looking forward to connecting with students and making beautiful music together!",
